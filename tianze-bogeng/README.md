To compare OSM with Google Map by route's distance ratio
Type two parameters in the format of example: 100 0.2
The first parameter is the amount of routes you want to generate.
The second parameter is difference-ratio cap you want to set. Any route with difference-ratio more than 0.2 would be printed. (Most of the ratio is less than 0.05, so please don't set it too high, otherwise it won't print much)
